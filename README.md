# Microscope-TTRPG-Client
A project I started working on to play the Microscope TTRPG with my friends.

There's a TTRPG game named Microscope that you're supposed to play in-person with index cards. I have some people I want to play with and we can't meet up in person,
so I decided to use what I recently learned about networking from my terrible chat program as well as what I already know about making GUIs to create a program that I can
use to play Microscope with people online. As of writing, it's still very much WIP, and I'm having to learn a lot more about GUIs than I expected in order to make this, but
the end goal is to have a usable and fairly intuitive application for playing Microscope.

It will work using a client/server system, and the host of the game will need to have a little bit of technical knowledge. Just enough to port forward and get your own IP address
so that others can connect to you. If you can do that, you can host the game of Microscope and other people will be able to join.

IF I stay motivated enough to finish this project...
